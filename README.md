# RockPaperScissors_Game
**Step By Step Logic**
- Ask the user for their input
- it has to be one of rock, paper or scissors
- Store the input in a string
- While storing the input, convert all characters to lower case to handle the rock, Rock, RoCK like inputs
- Compare and check if the input is anything other than rock, paper or scissors
- give an error message and ask for user input again
- If input is valid - then execute remaining code
